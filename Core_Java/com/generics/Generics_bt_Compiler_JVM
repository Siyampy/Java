//is been compiled and JVM has no work to do with the parametrs even when we  mention the parameters
//JVM treats as the normal ones and we can use multiple References other than the type mentined i the parameter.
//ie
//AL l=new Al();
//AL l=new Al<Integer>();
//
//AL l=new Al<Double>();
//
//AL l=new Al<Float>();

//All these declarations are same and equal to the JVM and it wont cause ANY type cast prolems


// But Compiler checks the type
//
//Al<String> l=new Al();
//Al<String> l=new AL<String>();
//both are equal but second one restricts adding other datatype othe than the String
